//! \defgroup media_buf_mgr Media Buffer Manager
//! \ingroup ddi_media
//! \brief Manages shared buffers for media drivers.
//!
//! \section intro Introduction
//!
//! The media buffer manager allows media drivers and related code to share a
//! set of common buffers, which is much more memory efficient than each code
//! module having its own buffers. It can work with both permanent, pre-allocated
//! buffers as well as temporary buffers it dynamically allocates itself. The
//! application can add any number of permanent buffers, thus controlling the
//! tradeoff between performance and memory. This also allows the application to
//! handle situations such as when NCNB memory cannot be allocated at runtime.
//!
//! The buffers under control of the buffer manager have several attributes.
//! The first is their type. Instead of specifying buffers by a size in
//! bytes, an enumerated list of types is used. This allows the caller to
//! pass along extra semantic information about the purpose of the buffer.
//! Currently this is only useful for programmers reviewing the code, but
//! it could potentially be put to other purposes in the future.
//!
//! The two types of buffers currently supported are:
//!     - #kMediaBufferType_Sector: A buffer at least as large as
//!          the page size of the currently attached NAND device.
//!     - #kMediaBufferType_Auxiliary: A buffer large enough to
//!         hold the auxiliary data required by the ECC8 engine.
//!
//! In addition to a type, each buffer has a set of flags. The only flags
//! that are implemented now are as follows:
//!     - #kMediaBufferFlag_NCNB: The buffer is located in non-cacheable,
//!         non-bufferable memory.
//!     - #kMediaBufferFlag_FastMemory: The buffer is within "fast"
//!         memory, usually OCRAM.
//!
//! \section usage Using the APIs
//!
//! In order for the buffer manager to be used, it must first be initialised.
//! This is done with a call to media_buffer_init(), which takes no parameters.
//! A set of buffers is pre-allocated by the manager so that it is immediately
//! usable. If you wish to add additional buffers, see the media_buffer_add() API.
//!
//! To get a buffer to use, a driver will call media_buffer_acquire(). It provides
//! information about the buffer it needs, including the type and a set of
//! desired flags. The buffer manager will make an attempt to
//! match the specifications exactly, but if that is not possible it will
//! try to find a close match amongst the available buffers already under
//! its control. Only as a last resort will it allocate memory using the
//! malloc() and specialised related functions from the DMI API (used to
//! allocate memory with special conditions such as NCNB). Wherever the buffer
//! comes from, it will always match the requested flags. However, a larger
//! buffer may be used for a small request
//!
//! These allocated buffers are called temporary buffers due to the fact that
//! they are deallocated when the caller is finished with them. Buffers added
//! with the buffer_add() API are called permanent buffers.
//!
//! The caller can use the buffer it acquired for as long as it likes, and
//! can hold any number of buffers at once. When finished, a call to
//! media_buffer_release() puts the buffer back under control of the buffer manager
//! and makes it available for other callers to use.
//!
//! If the buffer being released is a temporary buffer, it is returned to the
//! manager just like permanent buffers, but only for a short time. If the
//! buffer is still unused after this time expires, it is completely deallocated.
//! Reacquiring a temporary buffer waiting to expire will restart the process.
//! This mechanism keeps from repeatedly allocating and freeing buffers during
//! bursts of activity, while allowing efficient use of memory during idle time.

//! \brief Obtain a free buffer of the requested type.
//!
//! Clients call this function to get a buffer that they can use for any length
//! of time. The parameters specify the desired attributes of the buffer,
//! including its type. The buffer manager first makes an attempt to find a
//! pre-existing buffer that exactly matches the requested attributes. If that
//! fails, further attempts are made, looking for a buffer that is as close a
//! match as possible.
//!
//! Flags take precedence over size. In other words, given a choice between
//! buffer "A" that matches required flags but is larger, and
//! buffer "B" that is an exact size match but doesn't match all of the
//! flags, the buffer manager will choose buffer "A".
//!
//! In the case where no pre-existing buffers are available that match, this
//! function will allocate a temporary buffer from dynamic memory. The
//! allocated buffer will match both required and optional flags. For example,

//! Permanent buffers that are released are made immediately available to other
